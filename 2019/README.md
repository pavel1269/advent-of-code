Here are my scripts which i used for solving.

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## Disclaimer

Code is very rough (not clean) and by doing part 2 i might have broken part 1 code. Some parts also run very slowly.

## How to use

- All scripts are written in a way that current working directory has to be their folder.
- `*.Tests.ps1` contains unit tests.
Execute a file for checking written code against given set of test.
- Calculation of result is in the main file, look for function called e.g. `Get-Part1Result` or `Get-ResultPart1`
